# ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks
## My course exercises in the CNN course, where I learned main characteristics of CNNs that make them suitable for image processing, inner workings, and how to build them from start 
  - Learned about autoencoders (critical architecture for modern CNNS)
  - Learn about use in anomaly detection, image denoising
  - Learn how to use CNNS for object detection, semantic segmentation
